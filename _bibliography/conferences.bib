abstract="Chatbots are gaining significant relevance due to their enormous potential in various sectors, particularly education. The COVID-19 pandemic led to suspending in-person classes for students and teachers, creating an opportunity for research in developing educational chatbots. However, the proposal of a widely accepted structure for chatbots poses a challenge due to the constant evolution of technologies and tools employed in their implementation and deployment. Moreover, generic chatbot architectures present limitations when instantiated in specific contexts. For instance, in the case of educational chatbots, it is necessary to have an architecture specifically tailored to the functionalities required in the academic domain. This article follows a formal approach to designing and implementing a software architecture for educational chatbots. We rely on an iterative method called ADD 3.0 to achieve this objective. Our proposal consists of a three-tier architecture to define the component distribution of chatbots and a six-layer architecture to specify their structure.",

abstract="Nowadays, advancements in sensor technologies, microcontrollers, and radiofrequency systems have facilitated the development of systems capable of measuring various physical parameters in diverse environments. This progression underscores the necessity for seamless integration of these systems to accomplish diverse objectives. Digital companions, epitomizing this trend, are computer-assisted systems designed to synergize with human users. They are a nexus between rigorous process efficiency, voluminous data management, and human interactions. In response to the imperative for integrating these technological and scientific innovations, a compelling proposition has emerged to develop a digital companion architecture tailored to assist patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes. This proposed architecture comprises various services, including speech recognition and biometric monitoring control. These elements are integral to the system's ability to deliver tailored and effective responses to the user, aiming to enhance the quality of life for individuals suffering from this chronic disease. Preliminary evaluations of a prototype grounded in our architecture demonstrate a positive anticipated user experience.",

abstract="Organizations are constantly navigating a complex landscape of users, information, and security policies. Nomadic workers and visitors move throughout the organization, accessing resources and services to accomplish their goals. However, existing access control solutions often follow a general-purpose centralized approach, which can lead to limitations such as system bottlenecks and failures, and misunderstanding and confusion in people. In some cases, access control is performed in a manual way by the own workers. In this paper, we propose an innovative solution: an Area Management System (AMS) that addresses the unique needs of nomadic users. AMS takes into account the goals and requirements of nomadic users, the security policies of organizations, and the permissions and restrictions of specific areas. By distributing access control management, our solution can provide a more efficient and comprehensive approach to administrating resources, services, and information within an area.",

abstract="The rising prevalence of chronic conditions has fuelled the development of numerous devices and IoT systems to improve patients' health outcomes. Despite the abundance of these solutions, their usability remains a significant challenge, hindering their adoption and effectiveness. This paper proposes a conceptual interaction design framework for IoT healthcare systems that prioritises the three critical components of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. To develop the framework, we conducted a state of the art review and interviewed patients and health experts using the Design Sprint methodology. This resulted in the creation of three personas and their related user stories. Our framework consists of three main components: User Interfaces as Services, Context-Aware Interactions, and User-Centred Data Management. A hypothetical scenario of a digital companion for individuals with diabetes was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the framework. The results of the proposal underscore the importance of considering all stakeholders when designing IoT systems and highlight the potential for individuals to benefit from a more integrated and personalised experience.",

abstract={Nowadays, an important part of academic education comes from online information, such as class topics, homework, and practices. In this sector, chatbots can be a valuable tool in the teaching/learning process by providing information about courses, procedures, and school services. Thus, the deployment of chatbots in schools and universities starts having a high priority for the academic staff. Nevertheless, most chatbots lack mechanisms to adequately integrate into the educational activities, since they should be useful for teachers, students, and educative assistant personnel (e.g., social workers, psychologists, pedagogues, and prefects). In this article, we propose a chatbot whose primary objective is to serve as an extra-school tool and as an intermediary between teachers and students. In this way, students could express themselves more freely, since the chatbot acts as a bridge with their teachers and other involved personnel. Our prototype was developed as a Web application that provides a text-based user interface and defines several interaction profiles to encompass the specific functions of the different actors in the teaching/learning process. We evaluated the proposed chatbot with the participation of third-year middle school students and teachers. In particular, we measured the workload perceived by our participants after performing a series of tasks. According to our results, our chatbot mostly obtained positive impressions from the test participants.},

abstract={Home security systems are increasingly popular and affordable. Whether DIY solutions with various accessories or simpler proposals, they are a tool that many consider essential for their home. However, these systems are not without problems. An important one is the anxiety and the sensation of siege that can cause, i.e., that users feel insecure inside their own homes. We propose five design guides focused on consistency, through these and with the help of five experts we perform a heuristic evaluation of three popular solutions in the market to try to find the causes that lead to the harmful effects of security systems. Our results reveal that the leading cause of the false siege is the excess of notifications.},

abstract={Thanks to the hyperconnected world in which we live, we are surrounded by devices. Many of these devices can communicate with each other, and even they can support the same application so that the user can have multiple forms of interaction. However, developers should be careful when considering the control level left to users, since the applications may become unusable. Whether the system or user decides the distribution of the available devices, Graphical User Interface (GUI) consistency must always be preserved. Consistency not only provides users with a robust framework in similar contexts but is an essential learning element and a lever to ensure the GUI efficient usage. This paper proposes a set of consistency guidelines that serve as a means for the construction of multi-device applications.

  abstract={Online social networks provide technological support for making up virtual groups of any size, whose members share common interests and interact through the Internet. A person joins a social network not only owing to its popularity and the quality of its contents, but also thanks to the User Experience (UX) that the platform offers. A crucial factor in the growth and survival of any virtual social group is participation, which should be facilitated by suitable user tools supplied by the platform. However, this is not always the case. Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations, hopes, and desires of the users in a very early stage of any development. In this paper, we propose an AUX and UX evaluation method for user tools of social networks, whose goal is to improve their design, and through it, the participation of people. We tested our method by an experimental design that included the construction of paper prototypes and execution of tasks in actual platforms. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. As shown by our results, based on their previous experience, participants have fixed ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations are not met.},

  abstract={Social networks are a meeting point on the Internet; people use them to exchange opinions, help each other, or have fun. The growth and success of a social network are multifactorial phenomena but can be generalised into two factors: the quality of the content, and the User eXperience (UX) that the platform offers. Thus, the design of the GUI of a social network must come from the needs of its users. It is necessary to study the UX over time, before and after the development of the platform. Before, the Anticipated User eXperience (AUX) allows knowing the idealisations and desires of users. After, the UX is the measure of the actual system. We propose a UX over time evaluation method for user tools in social networks to have a way to contrast both results, improve the design of user tools, and finally increase participation. To test our evaluation method, we designed an experiment in which users had to devise on paper different user tools. Then, they had to evaluate similar elements but this time in actual social networks. The AUX and UX of the participants were measured with AttrakDiff. Our results show that, based on their previous experience, participants had established ideas on the behaviour of user tools, having a visible impact when their expectations were not met.},
