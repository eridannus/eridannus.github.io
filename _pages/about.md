Hello! I'm Martín, a PhD student in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.cinvestav.mx/){:target="_blank"} at [Cinvestav-IPN](https://www.cinvestav.mx/){:target="_blank"}. My research interests are Human-Computer Interaction, User Interface Design, User Experience, and Social Media. Although they're not areas of my speciality, I'm also interested in digital rights, privacy and security, Philosophy, and Philology.

My (great) advisors are professor [Sonia Mendoza](http://delta.cs.cinvestav.mx/~smendoza/){:target="_blank"} and professor [Beatriz González](http://aisii.azc.uam.mx/investigadores/Adriana/){:target="_blank"}.
